        <h3>Best Chicken Milanese</h3>
        <p>Chicken Milanese is an Italian dish that typically consists of breaded and fried chicken cutlets. The dish is named after the Italian city of Milan. The chicken cutlets are usually boneless and skinless breasts, pounded thin to ensure even cooking.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (100g) breadcrumbs (you can use plain or seasoned breadcrumbs)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (60g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Olive oil, for frying</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to a low temperature (around 200째F or 95째C) to keep the cooked chicken warm.</li>           <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes. In the first dish, place the flour. In the second dish, beat the eggs. In the third dish, combine the breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip the chicken into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the chicken in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing the breadcrumbs onto the chicken to adhere.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the breaded chicken cutlets for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165째F (74째C).</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a baking sheet and keep warm in the preheated oven.</li>
            <li>Serve the Chicken Milanese with lemon wedges for squeezing over the top. It is often served with a simple salad or pasta on the side.</li>
